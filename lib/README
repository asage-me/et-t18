# This directory is intended for project specific (private) libraries.
#
# PlatformIO will compile them to static libraries and link into executable file.
#
# The source code of each library should be placed in a separate directory
# (e.g., lib/MyLibrary/MyLibrary.h and lib/MyLibrary/MyLibrary.cpp).
